    <h1>what is this project?</h1>
    <p>
      this is a historical archive of file formats in silent hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      right now, it just contains every model (.mdl) file in silent hill 2 restless dreams (pc).
    </p>
    <p>
      it is inspired by
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a love for silent hill</li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://noclip.website">noclip.website</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>is it finished?</h1>
    <p>
      no, there is still a lot of mystery. i would absolutely love if you can contribute
      on <a href="https://github.com/laura-a-n-n/silent-hill-museum">github</a>.
    </p>
    <h1>what features are planned?</h1>
    <p>
      a future goal is to enable editing of these file formats, so you can import
      edited assets into the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      another goal is to add more file formats, including maps and animations,
      and formats for other games in the silent hill series.

    </p> -->
    <h1>how does it work?</h1>
    <p>
      it parses the .mdl files directly in your browser and renders them using
      the <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> library.
    </p>
    <p>
      i've documented the vast majority of the .mdl file format by representing it in
      <a href="https://kaitai.io">kaitai struct</a>, a declarative binary parsing
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      the .ksy file is compiled into a javascript parser and typescript definitions,
      allowing the kaitai js runtime to bring this theater to you.
    </p>
    <h1>can i use this for commercial purposes?</h1>
    <p>do not.</p>

    <h1>who made this?</h1>
    <p>
      right now, it's just me, <a href="https://github.com/laura-a-n-n">laura ann</a>.
      but i couldn't have done this without the efforts of some people on the internet,
      who i haven't talked to yet, but their resources have been invaluable:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/Quaker762">quaker762</a>
        and <a href="https://github.com/GirianSeed">girianseed</a>, who published
        <a href="https://github.com/Palm-Studios/sh2_source">sh2_source</a>,
        a repository containing the dwarf debug symbols of silent hill 2.
      </li>
      <li>
        quaker762 also published an initial
        <a

      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/iOrange">iorange</a>, who very recently made
        <a href="https://github.com/iOrange/sh2tex">sh2tex</a>,
        which is a really excellent texture extractor for silent hill 2.
        pretty much all the work done on textures here is directly from them.
      </li>
      <li>
        perdedork, who discovered
        all this and more, many years ago. perdedork made the

          silent hill level viewer</a>.
        i haven't seen the code for this viewer, but it is a really good program.
